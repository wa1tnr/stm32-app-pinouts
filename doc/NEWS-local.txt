   news - STM32F407 Discovery found in the 'good' plastic bin
          with several other targets (incl. 2x mounted Black Pill
          targets).

   That means additional tests can be run.  Thinking about a
   mecrisp install, looking for one USART pair that could work
   on F405 Express as well (Ting's eForth runs on all three
   targets, unmodified: F405, F407 and F411 .. probably others).

   Since PB6 PB7 already works on Black Pill and F407 Discovery,
   defining it for mecrisp F407 (if it isn't already) may be
   the right way to go here (following Ting's lead).
