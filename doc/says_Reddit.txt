    "Check out AN2606. You need to use either PA9/PA10 or PD5/PD6 for the uart, and send 0x7f to enter the bootloader."

    Note: had AN2606 on-hand already.  Probably had a reason for that.

    Will try: PA9/PA10 and CP2104 Friend; may try the pullups to 3.3 (100k) on TX/RX (PA9/PA10 or swapped PA10/PA9).

    Seems to suggest the upload routines resident on the chip utilize the Intel .HEX format, and to start it (get it recognized) by sending the byte 0x7F once.


end.
